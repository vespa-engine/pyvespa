[Vespa](https://vespa.ai/) is the scalable open-sourced serving engine that enables users to store,
compute and rank big data at user serving time.
`pyvespa` provides a python API to Vespa.
It allows users to create, modify, deploy and interact with running Vespa instances.
The main goal of the library is to allow for faster prototyping and get familiar with Vespa features.
