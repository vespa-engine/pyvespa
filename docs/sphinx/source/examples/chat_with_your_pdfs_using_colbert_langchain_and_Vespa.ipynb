        "\n",
        "- Eliminating compromises in precision introduced by approximate algorithms\n",
        "- Achieve significantly higher write throughput, thanks to the absence of index builds required for supporting approximate search.\n",
        "- Optimize efficiency by storing documents, including tensors and data, on disk, benefiting from the cost-effective economics of storage tiers.\n",

In ColBERT, the relevance between a query and document is estimated by computing the sum of maximum similarities between each query vector and all vectors in the document at the token level. This allows ColBERT to delegate query-document matching to the interaction mechanism and encode meaning at the token level. On the other hand, single vector models directly model relevance using a dot product between the query and document vectors. The late interaction approach of ColBERT aims to reduce the burden on the encoder by decomposing relevance modeling into token-level computations. However, late interaction models like ColBERT typically have a larger space footprint compared to single vector models, as they store billions of small vectors for large-scale collections.
