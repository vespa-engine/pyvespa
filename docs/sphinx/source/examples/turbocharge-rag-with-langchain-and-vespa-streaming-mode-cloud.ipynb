    "# Turbocharge RAG with LangChain and Vespa Streaming Mode for Partitioned Data \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates using [Vespa streaming mode](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/streaming-search.html)\n",
    "to build cost-efficient RAG applications over naturally sharded data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about Vespa vector streaming search in these blog posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Announcing vector streaming search: AI assistants at scale without breaking the bank](https://blog.vespa.ai/announcing-vector-streaming-search/)\n",
    "- [Yahoo Mail turns to Vespa to do RAG at scale](https://blog.vespa.ai/yahoo-mail-turns-to-vespa-to-do-rag-at-scale/)\n",
    "- [Hands-On RAG guide for personal data with Vespa and LLamaIndex](https://blog.vespa.ai/scaling-personal-ai-assistants-with-streaming-mode/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is also available in blog form: [Turbocharge RAG with LangChain and Vespa Streaming Mode for Sharded Data](https://blog.vespa.ai/turbocharge-rag-with-langchain-and-vespa-streaming-mode/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### TLDR; Vespa streaming mode for partitioned data\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa's streaming search solution enables you to integrate a user ID (or any sharding key) into the Vespa document ID. \n",
    "This setup allows Vespa to efficiently group each user's data on a small set of nodes and the same disk chunk.\n",
    "Streaming mode enables low latency searches on a user's data without keeping data in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefits of streaming mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminating compromises in precision introduced by approximate algorithms\n",
    "- Achieve significantly higher write throughput, thanks to the absence of index builds required for supporting approximate search.\n",
    "- Optimize efficiency by storing documents, including tensors and data, on disk, benefiting from the cost-effective economics of storage tiers.\n",
    "- Storage cost is the primary cost driver of Vespa streaming mode; no data is in memory. Avoiding memory usage lowers deployment costs significantly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting LangChain Retriever with Vespa for Context Retrieval from PDF Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we seamlessly integrate a custom [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) \n",
    "[retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/) with a Vespa app, \n",
    "leveraging Vespa's streaming mode to extract meaningful context from PDF documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow \n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and deploy a Vespa [application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html) using PyVespa. \n",
    "- Utilize [LangChain PDF Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf) to download and parse PDF files.\n",
    "- Leverage [LangChain Document Transformers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)\n",
    "to convert each PDF page into multiple text chunks. \n",
    "- Feed the transformer representation to the running Vespa instance\n",
    "- Employ Vespa's built-in embedder functionality (using an open-source embedding model) for embedding the text chunks per page, resulting in a multi-vector representation.\n",
    "- Develop a custom [Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) to enable seamless retrieval for any unstructured text query.\n",

When batching, wepad all documents to the maximum length of a document withinthe batch.3To make capping the sequence length on a per-batchbasis more e\\ufb00ective, our indexer proceeds through documents ingroups of B(e.g., B=100,000) documents. It sorts these documentsby length and then feeds batches of b(e.g., b=128) documents ofcomparable length through our encoder. /T_his length-based bucket-ing is sometimes refered to as a BucketIterator in some libraries(e.g., allenNLP).
