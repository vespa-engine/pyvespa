    "# Feeding to Vespa Cloud\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [previous notebook](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/feed_performance.html), we demonstrated one way of benchmarking feed performance to a local Vespa instance running in Docker.\n",
    "In this notebook, we will llok at the same methods, but how feeding to [Vespa Cloud](https://cloud.vespa.ai) affects performance of the different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key difference between feeding to a local Vespa instance and a Vespa Cloud instance is the network latency.\n",
    "Additionally, we will introduce embedding in Vespa at feed time, which is a realistic scenario for many use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at these 3 different methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using `feed_iterable()` - which uses threading to parallelize the feed operation. Best for CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "2. Using `feed_async_iterable()` - which uses asyncio to parallelize the feed operation. Also uses `httpx` with HTTP/2-support. Performs best for IO-bound operations.\n",
    "3. Using [Vespa CLI](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/vespa-cli).\n"
