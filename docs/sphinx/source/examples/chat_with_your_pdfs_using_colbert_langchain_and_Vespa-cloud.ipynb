    "# Chat with your pdfs with ColBERT, langchain, and Vespa\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates using [Vespa streaming mode](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/streaming-search.html)\n",
    "to build cost-efficient RAG applications over naturally sharded data. It also demonstrates how you can now use ColBERT ranking natively in Vespa, which can now handle the ColBERT embedding process for you with no custom code!\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about Vespa vector streaming search in these blog posts:\n",
    "\n",

    "### TLDR; Vespa streaming mode for partitioned data\n",
    "\n",
    "Vespa's streaming search solution enables you to integrate a user ID (or any sharding key) into the Vespa document ID.\n",
    "This setup allows Vespa to efficiently group each user's data on a small set of nodes and the same disk chunk.\n",
    "Streaming mode enables low latency searches on a user's data without keeping data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefits of streaming mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eliminating compromises in precision introduced by approximate algorithms\n",
    "- Achieve significantly higher write throughput, thanks to the absence of index builds required for supporting approximate search.\n",
    "- Optimize efficiency by storing documents, including tensors and data, on disk, benefiting from the cost-effective economics of storage tiers.\n",
    "- Storage cost is the primary cost driver of Vespa streaming mode; no data is in memory. Avoiding memory usage lowers deployment costs significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting LangChain Retriever with Vespa for Context Retrieval from PDF Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we seamlessly integrate a custom [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction)\n",
    "[retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/) with a Vespa app,\n",
    "leveraging Vespa's streaming mode to extract meaningful context from PDF documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define and deploy a Vespa [application package](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/application-packages.html) using PyVespa.\n",
    "- Utilize [LangChain PDF Loaders](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_loaders/pdf) to download and parse PDF files.\n",
    "- Leverage [LangChain Document Transformers](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/)\n",
    "to convert each PDF page into multiple model context-sized parts.\n",
    "- Feed the transformer representation to the running Vespa instance\n",
    "- Employ Vespa's built-in [ColBERT embedder functionality](https://blog.vespa.ai/announcing-long-context-colbert-in-vespa/) (using an open-source embedding model) for embedding the contexts, resulting in a multi-vector representation per context\n",
    "- Develop a custom [Retriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/) to enable seamless retrieval for any unstructured text query.\n",

An alternative is late interaction , in-troduced in ColBERT (Khattab and Zaharia, 2020),',\n",

       "[Document(page_content='ture that precisely does so. As illustrated, every query embeddinginteracts with all document embeddings via a MaxSim operator,which computes maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity), andthe scalar outputs of these operators are summed across queryterms. /T_his paradigm allows ColBERT to exploit deep LM-basedrepresentations while shi/f_ting the cost of encoding documents of-/f_line and amortizing the cost of encoding the query once acrossall ranked documents. Additionally, it enables ColBERT to lever-age vector-similarity search indexes (e.g., [ 1,15]) to retrieve thetop-kresults directly from a large document collection, substan-tially improving recall over models that only re-rank the output ofterm-based retrieval.As Figure 1 illustrates, ColBERT can serve queries in tens orfew hundreds of milliseconds. For instance, when used for re-ranking as in ‚ÄúColBERT (re-rank)‚Äù, it delivers over 170 √óspeedup(and requires 14,000 √ófewer FLOPs) relative to existing BERT-based ### models, while being more eÔ¨Äective than every non-BERT baseline(¬ß4.2 & 4.3). ColBERT‚Äôs indexing‚Äîthe only time it needs to feeddocuments through BERT‚Äîis also practical: it can index the MSMARCO collection of 9M passages in about 3 hours using a singleserver with four GPUs ( ¬ß4.5), retaining its eÔ¨Äectiveness with a spacefootprint of as li/t_tle as few tens of GiBs. Our extensive ablationstudy ( ¬ß4.4) shows that late interaction, its implementation viaMaxSim operations, and crucial design choices within our BERT-based encoders are all essential to ColBERT‚Äôs eÔ¨Äectiveness.Our main contributions are as follows.(1)We propose late interaction (¬ß3.1) as a paradigm for eÔ¨Écientand eÔ¨Äective neural ranking.(2)We present ColBERT ( ¬ß3.2 & 3.3), a highly-eÔ¨Äective modelthat employs novel BERT-based query and document en-coders within the late interaction paradigm.', metadata={'title': 'ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf', 'page': 4, 'authors': ['Omar Khattab', 'Matei Zaharia'], 'features': {'cos_sim': 0.6664045997289173, 'max_sim': 124.19231414794922, 'max_sim_per_context': {'0': 124.19231414794922, '1': 92.21265411376953}}})]"

       "'ColBERT, introduced by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, is a novel ranking model that employs contextualized late interaction over deep language models (LMs), specifically focusing on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for efficient and effective passage search. It achieves this by independently encoding queries and documents into fine-grained representations that interact via cheap and pruning-friendly computations. This approach allows ColBERT to leverage the expressiveness of deep LMs while significantly speeding up query processing compared to existing BERT-based models. ColBERT also enables end-to-end neural retrieval directly from a large document collection, offering more than 170 times faster performance and requiring 14,000 times fewer FLOPs (floating-point operations) per query than previous BERT-based models, with minimal impact on quality. It outperforms every non-BERT baseline in effectiveness (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf, page 18).\\n\\nColBERT differentiates itself with a mechanism that delays the query-document interaction, which allows for pre-computation of document representations for cheap neural re-ranking and supports practical end-to-end neural retrieval through pruning via vector-similarity search. This method preserves the effectiveness of state-of-the-art models that condition most of their computations on the joint query-document pair, making ColBERT a scalable solution for passage search challenges (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf, page 6).'"

       "'The ColBERT MaxSim operator is a mechanism for computing the maximum similarity between query embeddings and document embeddings. It operates by calculating the maximum similarity (e.g., cosine similarity) for each query embedding with all document embeddings, and then summing the scalar outputs of these operations across query terms. This paradigm enables the efficient and effective retrieval of documents by allowing for the interaction between deep language model-based representations of queries and documents to occur in a late stage of the processing pipeline, thereby shifting the cost of encoding documents offline and amortizing the cost of encoding the query across all ranked documents. Additionally, the MaxSim operator facilitates the use of vector-similarity search indexes to directly retrieve the top-k results from a large document collection, substantially improving recall over models that only re-rank the output of term-based retrieval. This operator is a key component of ColBERT\\'s approach to efficient and effective passage search.\\n\\nSource: \"ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT\" by Omar Khattab and Matei Zaharia, page 4, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf'"

       "'The main difference between ColBERT and single-vector representational models lies in their approach to handling document and query representations for information retrieval tasks. ColBERT utilizes a multi-vector representation for both queries and documents, whereas single-vector models encode each query and each document into a single, dense vector.\\n\\n1. **Multi-Vector vs. Single-Vector Representations**: ColBERT leverages a late interaction mechanism that allows for fine-grained matching between the multiple embeddings of query terms and document tokens. This approach enables capturing the nuanced semantics of the text by considering the contextualized representation of each term separately. On the other hand, single-vector models compress the entire content of a document or a query into a single dense vector, which might lead to a loss of detail and context specificity.\\n\\n2. **Efficiency and Effectiveness**: While single-vector models might be simpler and potentially faster in some scenarios due to their straightforward matching mechanism (e.g., cosine similarity between query and document vectors), this simplicity could come at the cost of effectiveness. ColBERT, with its detailed interaction between term-level vectors, can offer more accurate retrieval results because it preserves and utilizes the rich semantic relationships within and across the text of queries and documents. However, ColBERT\\'s detailed approach initially required more storage and computational resources compared to single-vector models. Nonetheless, advancements like ColBERTv2 have significantly improved the efficiency, achieving competitive storage requirements and reducing the computational cost while maintaining or even enhancing retrieval effectiveness.\\n\\n3. **Compression and Storage**: Initial versions of multi-vector models like ColBERT required significantly more storage space compared to single-vector models due to storing multiple vectors per document. However, with the introduction of techniques like residual compression in ColBERTv2, the storage requirements have been drastically reduced to levels competitive with single-vector models. Single-vector models, while naturally more storage-efficient, can also be compressed, but aggressive compression might exacerbate the loss in quality.\\n\\n4. **Search Quality and Compression**: Despite the potential for aggressive compression in single-vector models, such approaches often lead to a more pronounced loss in quality compared to late interaction methods like ColBERTv2. ColBERTv2, even when employing compression techniques to reduce its storage footprint, can achieve higher quality across systems, showcasing the robustness of its retrieval capabilities even when optimizing for space efficiency.\\n\\nIn summary, the difference between ColBERT and single-vector representational models is primarily in their approach to encoding and matching queries and documents, with ColBERT focusing on detailed, term-level interactions for improved accuracy, and single-vector models emphasizing simplicity and compactness, which might come at the cost of retrieval effectiveness.\\n\\nCitations:\\n- Santhanam et al., \"ColBERTv2: Effective and Efficient Retrieval via Lightweight Late Interaction,\" p. 14, 15, 17, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.01488.pdf'"

       "\"ColBERT is designed to efficiently handle the interaction between query and document representations through a mechanism called late interaction, which is particularly beneficial when dealing with longer documents. This is because ColBERT independently encodes queries and documents into fine-grained representations using BERT, and then employs a cheap yet powerful interaction step that models their fine-grained similarity. This approach allows for the pre-computation of document representations offline, significantly speeding up query processing by avoiding the need to feed each query-document pair through a massive neural network at query time.\\n\\nFor longer documents, the benefits of this approach are twofold:\\n\\n1. **Efficiency in Handling Long Documents**: Since ColBERT encodes document representations offline, it can efficiently manage longer documents without a proportional increase in computational cost at query time. This is unlike traditional BERT-based models that might require more computational resources to process longer documents due to their size and complexity.\\n\\n2. **Effectiveness in Capturing Fine-Grained Semantics**: The fine-grained representations and the late interaction mechanism enable ColBERT to effectively capture the nuances and detailed semantics of longer documents. This is crucial for maintaining high retrieval quality, as longer documents often contain more information and require a more nuanced understanding to match relevant queries accurately.\\n\\nThus, ColBERT's architecture, which leverages the strengths of BERT for deep language understanding while introducing efficiencies through late interaction, makes it particularly adept at handling longer documents. It achieves this by pre-computing and efficiently utilizing detailed semantic representations of documents, enabling both high-quality retrieval and significant speed-ups in query processing times compared to traditional BERT-based models.\\n\\nReference: ColBERT: Efficient and Effective Passage Search via Contextualized Late Interaction over BERT by ['Omar Khattab', 'Matei Zaharia'] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12832.pdf), page 4.\""
