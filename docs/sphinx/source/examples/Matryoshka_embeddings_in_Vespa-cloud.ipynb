This allow us to trade off a small amount of accuracy in exchange for much smaller embedding sizes, so we can store more documents and search them faster.\n","\n","By using [phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html), we can re-rank the top K results with the full embeddings in a second step. This produces accuracy on par with using the full embeddings!\n","\n","We'll use a standard information retrieval benchmark to evaluate result quality with different embedding sizes and retrieval/ranking strategies.\n","\n","Let's get started!
