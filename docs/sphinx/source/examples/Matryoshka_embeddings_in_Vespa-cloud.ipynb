If this works well, it should indeed allow us to very easily trade off accuracy in exchange for smaller vector size, reducing both storage and computation costs while retaining quality.\n","\n","We'll use a standard information retrieval benchmark to measure retrieval quality with different embedding dimensions, and this will give us a chance to show how Vespa could elegantly accommodate this new technique without having to add any new features, using our flexible [tensor data model](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/tensor-user-guide.html).\n","\n","Let's get started!
