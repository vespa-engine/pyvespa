If you need to pass a float, you should convert it to a string before passing it to the tag constructor, e.g. `container(version=\"1.0\")`.\n",
    "- Note that we are _not_ escaping the values. In the xml file, the value of the `selection` attribute in the `document` tag is `music.timestamp &gt; now() - 86400`. (`&gt;` is the escaped form of `>`.) When passing this value to the `document` tag constructor in python, we should _not_ escape the `>` character, i.e. `document(selection=\"music.timestamp > now() - 86400\")`.\n"

    "## Example 2 - Configuring `requestthreads` per search\n",
    "\n",
    "In Vespa, there are several configuration options that might be tuned to optimize the serving latency of your application.\n",
    "For an overview, see the [Vespa documentation - Vespa Serving Scaling Guide](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/performance/sizing-search.html).\n",
    "An example of a configuration that one might want to tune is the `requestthreads` `persearch` [parameter](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services-content.html#requestthreads). This parameter controls the number of search threads that are used to handle each search on the content nodes. The default value is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some applications, where a significant portion of the work per query is linear with the number of documents, increasing the number of `requestthreads` `persearch` can improve the serving latency, as it allows more parallelism in the search phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of potentially expensive work that scales linearly with the number of documents, and thus are likely to benefit from increasing `requestthreads` `persearch` are: - Xgboost inference with a large GDBT-model - ONNX inference, e.g with a crossencoder. - MaxSim-operations for late interaction scoring, as in ColBERT and ColPali. - Exact nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of query operators that are less likely to benefit from increasing `requestthreads` `persearch` are: - `wand`/`weakAnd`, see [Using wand with Vespa](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/using-wand-with-vespa.html). - Approximate nearest neighbor search with HNSW.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will demonstrate an example of configuring `requestthreads` `persearch` to 4 for an application where a Crossencoder is used in first-phase ranking. The demo is based on the [Cross-encoders for global reranking](https://pyvespa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/cross-encoders-for-global-reranking.html) guide, but here we will use a cross-encoder in first-phase instead of global-phase. First-phase and second-phase ranking are executed on the content nodes, while global-phase ranking is executed on the container node. See [Phased ranking](https://docs.vespa.ai/en/phased-ranking.html) for more details.\n"
